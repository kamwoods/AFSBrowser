How to create Certificate to Sign Script
=======================================================================
-  yourkey can be changed to whatever you want your key to be named
-  yourcert.crt can be changed to whatever you want it to be named, but must have .crt extension
-  RunExecutable.java and RunExecutable.class should be the name of whichever java file you
   want to sign. In this case, we want RunExecutable.java to be signed.

Enter:
	keytool -genkey -kesyalg rsa -alias yourkey

Now we make the certificate:
	keytool -export -alias yourkey -file yourcert.crt

Now we have to sign the applet. Just make a *.bat file including this:
	javac RunExecutable.java
	jar cvf RunExecutable.jar RunExecutable.class
	jarsigner RunExecutable.jar yourkey

The batch-file compiles the applet, makes a jar-archive and signs the jar-file.

The HTML-code to display the applet:
	<applet code="RunExecutable.class" archive="RunExecutable.jar" width="600" height="500">
	<param name="exePath" value="C:\Legacy Emulation Assistant\Legacy Emulation Assistant.exe">
                  <param name="afsPath" value="\\afs\iu.edu\public\sudoc\volumes\04\30000038669341\30000038669341.iso">
	</applet>

- param "exePath" is the path to where Install.exe will put Legacy Emulation Assistant.exe
- param "afsPath" will be the path to an .ISO image from a web page.
       Example: A user clicks a button, from a web page, to open an .ISO, "afsPath" should be the path to that .ISO

Source for signing script: http://www.captain.at/programming/java/

NOTE:   For the java code and certificate to work like you want them to, RunExecutable.class,
               RunExecutable.jar and myCert2.crt must be in the same directory as the html file
               that contains the applet.

=======================================================================
 Build Legacy Emulation Assistant
=======================================================================
1. Open the solution (.sln) file in Mircrosoft Visual Studio 2008.
        - This should be either AFSBrowser.sln or possibly Legacy Emulation Assistant.sln
2. Click on Build, then Build Solution.
3. Now go to AFSBrowser directory and you can find the .EXE in ...\AFSBrowser\bin\Debug\
4. If you leave the .EXE in this location, you can run it and it should work. If you want to move 
     AFSBrowser.exe to another location you must also move the Interop.VixCOM.dll file to the 
     same new location. In short, AFSBrowser.exe and Interop.VixCOM.dll must be in the same
     directory for the program to work.
  
=======================================================================
Build Install
======================================================================= 
1. Open the solution (.sln) file in Mircrosoft Visual Studio 2008.
2. Click on Build, then Build Solution.
3. Now go to Install directory and you can find the .EXE in ...\Install\bin\Debug\
4. If you leave the .EXE in this location, you can run it and it should work. If you want to move 
     Install.exe to another location you must also move the Interop.VixCOM.dll file AND 
     AFSBrowser.exeto the same new location. In short, all three of these files must be in the 
     same directory for the program to work successfully.
